#### Hello! 👋 I'm Joy, a data analyst proficient in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, data visualization, machine learning, database management, and automation.


#### Tools
I can clean, analyze, extract, and visualize insights from data using 🐍 Python, 📊 SQL, 📑 Excel, and 📈 Power BI, and automate tasks using 🐚 Bash shell scripting.

🖥️ Linux | 📑 Excel | 📈 Power BI | 🐚 Bash | 🐍 Python | 🗃️ SQL (MSSQL & MySQL)

I use Python packages like Keras, sci-kit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly to build machine learning models and bring data science projects to life.
